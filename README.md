📊 Cyclistic Bike-Sharing Analysis – Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

🔍 Overview
This project is the final capstone of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera). I worked as a data analyst to help Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, better understand how annual members and casual riders use the service differently.

The ultimate goal of this analysis is to support the marketing team in designing effective campaigns to convert more casual riders into annual members.

🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

✅ Data cleaning (handling nulls, inconsistent data types, date/time parsing)

✅ Data transformation and feature engineering

✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization

✅ Drawing actionable business insights

✅ Communicating findings and recommendations clearly

🗂 Dataset

Provided by Cyclistic via Coursera.

Includes 12 months of ride data (2022).

Each record includes: rider type, start/end station, time, bike type, and more.

Some challenges included missing values, inconsistent datetime formats, and redundant columns.

🛠️ Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Git/GitHub for version control

🔧 Cleaning Steps

Converted date/time strings into proper datetime objects

Created new features (e.g., ride duration, day of week, time of day)

Removed rows with missing or corrupted values

Handled outliers (e.g., negative ride durations)

Normalized inconsistent column formats across monthly files

📈 Insights

Casual riders tend to have longer ride durations compared to members.

Annual members mostly use the service for weekday commuting, while casual riders show increased activity on weekends.

Casual riders prefer docked bikes, likely due to their availability and ease of use.

Members use bikes more regularly, possibly avoiding docked bikes due to potential limitations (e.g., station unavailability).

💡 Recommendations

Launch a Weekend-Only Membership Plan to attract weekend casual riders.

Create targeted promotions for weekday casual riders, highlighting potential savings from converting to membership.

Develop a loyalty program for frequent casual riders to gradually nudge them toward membership.
